	abstract={
		Processing of large amounts of data often consists of several steps, e.g. pre- and post-processing stages, which are executed sequentially with data written to disk after each step, however, when pre-processing stage for each task is different the more efficient way of processing data is to construct a pipeline which streams data from one stage to another. In a more general case some processing stages can be factored into several parallel subordinate stages thus forming a distributed pipeline where each stage can have multiple inputs and multiple outputs. Such processing pattern emerges in a problem of classification of wave energy spectra based on analytic approximations which can extract different wave systems and their parameters (e.g. wave system type, mean wave direction) from spectrum. Distributed pipeline approach achieves good performance compared to conventional “sequential-stage” processing.

		Nowadays, many cluster management systems rely on distributed consensus algorithms to elect a leader that orchestrates subordinate nodes. Contrary to these studies we propose consensus-free algorithm that arranges cluster nodes into multiple levels of subordination. The algorithm structures IP address range of cluster network so that each node has ranked list of candidates, from which it chooses a leader. The results show that this approach easily scales to a large number of nodes due to its asynchronous nature, and enables fast recovery from node failures as they occur only on one level of hierarchy. Multiple levels of subordination are useful for efficiently collecting monitoring and accounting data from large number of nodes, and for scheduling general-purpose tasks on a cluster.

		Nowadays supercomputer centers strive to provide their computational resources as services, however, present infrastructure is not particularly suited for such a use. First of all, there are standard application programming interfaces to launch computational jobs via command line or a web service, which work well for a program but turn out to be too complex for scientists: they want applications to be delivered to them from a remote server and prefer to interact with them via graphical interface. Second, there are certain applications which are dependent on older versions of operating systems and libraries and it is either non-practical to install those old systems on a cluster or there exists some conflict between these dependencies. Virtualization technologies can solve this problem, but they are not too popular in scientific computing due to overheads introduced by them. Finally, it is difficult to automatically estimate optimal resource pool size for a particular task, thus it often gets done manually by a user. If the large resource pool is requested for a minor task, the efficiency degrades. Moreover, cluster schedulers depend on estimated wall time to execute the jobs and since it cannot be reliably predicted by a human or a machine their efficiency suffers as well.

		Applications delivery, efficient operating system virtualization and dynamic application resource pool size defining constitute the two problems of scientific computing: complex application interfaces and inefficient use of resources available --- and virtual supercomputer is the way to solve them. The research shows that there are ways to make virtualization technologies efficient for scientific computing: the use of lightweight application containers and dynamic creation of these containers for a particular job are both fast and transparent for a user. There are universal ways to deliver application output to a front-end using execution of a job on a cluster and presenting its results in a graphical form. Finally, an application framework can be developed to decompose parallel application into small independent parts with easily predictable execution time, to simplify scheduling via existing algorithms.

		The aim of this chapter is to promote the key idea of a virtual supercomputer: to harness all available HPC resources and provide users with convenient access to them. Such a challenge can be effectively faced using contemporary virtualization technologies. They can materialize the long-term dream of having a supercomputer at your own desk.

	abstract={
		A hybrid cluster implies the use of computational devices with radically different architectures. Usually, these are conventional CPU architecture (e.g. {x86_64}) and GPU architecture (e. g. NVIDIA CUDA). Creating and exploiting such a cluster requires some experience: in order to harness all computational power of the described system and get substantial speedup for computational tasks many factors should be taken into account. These factors consist of hardware characteristics (e.g. network infrastructure, a type of data storage, GPU architecture) as well as software stack (e.g. MPI implementation, GPGPU libraries). So, in order to run scientific applications GPU capabilities, software features, task size and other factors should be considered.  

		This report discusses opportunities and problems of hybrid computations. Some statistics from tests programs and applications runs will be demonstrated. The main focus of interest is open source applications (e. g. OpenFOAM) that support GPGPU (with some parts rewritten to use GPGPU directly or by replacing libraries).  

		There are several approaches to organize heterogeneous computations for different GPU architectures out of which CUDA library and OpenCL framework are compared. CUDA library is becoming quite typical for hybrid systems with NVIDIA cards, but OpenCL offers portability opportunities which can be a determinant factor when choosing framework for development. We also put emphasis on multi-GPU systems that are often used to build hybrid clusters. Calculations were performed on a hybrid cluster of SPbU computing center.

		Virtual machines are usually associated with an ability to create them on demand by calling web services, then these machines are used to deliver resident services to their clients; however, providing clients with an ability to run an arbitrary programme on the newly created machines is beyond their power. Such kind of usage is useful in a high performance computing environment where most of the resources are consumed by batch programmes and not by daemons or services. In this case a cluster of virtual machines is created on demand to run a distributed or parallel programme and to save its output to a network attached storage. Upon completion this cluster is destroyed and resources are released. With certain modifications this approach can be extended to interactively deliver computational resources to the user thus providing virtual desktop as a service. Experiments show that the process of creating virtual clusters on demand can be made efficient in both cases.

		Optimal resource utilization is one of the most important and most challenging tasks for computational centers. A typical contemporary center includes several clusters. These clusters are used by many clients. So, administrators should set resource sharing policies that will meet different requirements of different groups of users. Users want to compute their tasks fast while organizations want their resources to be utilized efficiently. Traditional schedulers do not allow administrator to efficiently solve these problems in that way. Dynamic resource reallocation can improve the efficiency of system utilization while profiling running applications can generate important statistical data that can be used in order to optimize future application usage. These are basic advantages of a new scheduler that are discussed in this paper.
